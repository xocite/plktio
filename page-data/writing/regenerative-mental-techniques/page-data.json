The below is my framework for staying focused on deeply technical topics.</p>\n<h3>Mindset</h3>\n<p>I think it's incredibly important to <strong>reduce the number of decisions you make\ndaily</strong>.  I've noticed that on days where I have to make many little decisions\nI find myself too drained to think deeply.  You can achieve this through many\nmeans, here are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prepare your clothes for the following day before you sleep.  This reduces\nsome morning anxiety if you need to enter a workplace.</li>\n<li>Following on from the above, establish a morning routine that defines how\nyou'll exercise, what you'll eat, and your route of transportation.</li>\n<li>Try to reduce your eating frequency - I've found that eating twice a day or\neven once a day seems to improve mental clarity throughout the day.</li>\n<li>Accept failure and accept mistakes.  Problems are a part of life but they\nrarely pull you away from well-defined goals.  Accept them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Activities</h3>\n<p>Beyond setting the stage for a good, clear mind.  There are some activities you\ncan do to get unstuck when you can't seem to make headway.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Go for a walk</strong>.  I can't stress this enough - going for a walk, even for\nonly 5 minutes is the quickest and most reliable way I've found to unblock the\nmind.  Quell your worry by telling yourself it's only a 2 minute walk.  After\nyou step outside you'll likely walk for longer.  Don't be afraid to do\nmultiple loops.</li>\n<li>Read some fiction.  Immersing yourself in an alternate reality for a while can\nlet you stash some of your mental blockers.  Really focus on imagining what\nthe author wrote to make use of your left brain faculties.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Work</h3>\n<p>There are several patterns you can implement at work to help free your mind of\nunnecessary churning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Schedule times during the day to handle email.  Most email doesn't need to\nbe answered immediately.  This means not opening the mail app at all because\neven subject-line snooping will be enough to occupy your mind.</li>\n<li>Establish a protocol at work for urgent messages.  Let people know that\nurgent requests should include an expected response time and should ideally\nbe formatted in a y/n format so you can reply quickly.  </li>\n<li>Delegate where possible to people you trust.  Empower people to make\ndecisions on your behalf.</li>\n<li>Reduce \"get-started\" anxiety by letting people jump start their own ideas\nin a form light of requirements.  This is called MVP by some, MVC by others,\nbut empower people to propose things without worrying about having to\ndefine a completed product.</li>\n<li>When you leave the office, imagine yourself placing all your troubles into a\nbag or a container and dropping it at the entrance.  Know that you can\ncollect them the following day.  Really imagine the load being reduced as\nyou physically drop them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do you have other techniques for keeping your mind fresh throughout the day?\nLet me know!</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2019-07-21","updated":null,"path":"/writing/regenerative-mental-techniques","title":"Regenerative mental techniques"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
