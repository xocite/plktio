When we need to do something extraneous or beyond our natural capacity -- e.g. calculate our tax due, render our social image posts with filters in a decentralised manner, or send messages in other languages with real time translation, we'll need to use our phone, laptop, and other devices together to make the best impact.</p>\n<p>This will likely consist of multiple devices scanning the same QR code and using their compute power (across architectures: ARM, AMD, X86, X64) to do distributed, private, compute.</p>\n<p>More thoughts to come soon.  Let me know if you agree with this.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2019-07-19","updated":"2019-07-19","path":"/writing/future-of-computing","title":"Future of computing"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
