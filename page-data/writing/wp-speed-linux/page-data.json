It's a hit of nostalgia. However, I haven't really had time to\nconfigure it in detail. After a few hours walking down memory lane, I\nfinally have things configured how I like. Here's what I changed.</p>\n<h3>Terminal</h3>\n<p>I switched from gnome-terminal (Ubuntu default) to rxvt-unicode. Doing\nso required tweaking a lot of defaults in ~/.Xresources. I specified\nthe Zenburn theme as the default as it works all times of day. I also\npicked a large font for my 1980x1080 resolution so I don't strain my\neyes. Funnily enough, this simple configuration is very similar to a lot\nof the paid for apps on the iOS App Store that let you write with little\ndistractions.</p>\n<p>xlsfont can be used to list available fonts to place in your\n~/.Xresources. Alternatively, you can use the \"xft:\" specification to\nreference TrueType fonts with their human readable name.</p>\n<h3>Window manager</h3>\n<p>For the window manager, I migrated my entire workflow back to the\nlight-weight work-horse that is dwm. Dwm has been my favourite window\nmanager since I first bootstrapped a Gentoo installation back in 2008\n(see my old blog on Wordpress to read more about it).</p>\n<p>However, this wasn't without some difficulties as Ubuntu does provide a\nfull-fledged experience through Unity. I had to install/configure the\nfollowing programs to bring me back up to speed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Backlight. I installed xbacklight to configure the backlight.\nIncarnation is \"xbacklight -set %\". I can later update this to use\nthe Xorg XF86 keys so that Function+Arrow_Up =\nBrightness_Increment as it does on Ubuntu.</li>\n<li>Battery. To monitor battery I use the script I wrote below.\n<code class=\"language-text\">#!/bin/sh  while true; do   battery=cpi -b | awk &#39;{print $4}&#39; | sed &#39;s/,//&#39;  uptime=ptime -p  xsetroot -name &quot;$battery | $uptime&quot;   sleep 5s done</code></li>\n<li>Wifi. I patched dwm with the dwm systray patch available on\nsuckless.org and then added nm-applet (default network manager that\ncomes with Ubuntu) to my start up script. This way I still get a\nfully featured network manager that doesn't load all of Gnome.</li>\n<li>Loading apps. I use dmenu which is a standard part of the\nsuckless-utils.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All in all, switching back to <a href=\"https://dwm.suckless.org/\">dwm</a> has improved my productivity by a\nnoticeable amount as I spend less time managing windows and more time\nwriting content.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2019-07-19","updated":null,"path":"/writing/wp-speed-linux","title":"Getting back up to speed with Linu"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
