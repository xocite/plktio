Here are the steps I followed to avoid this\nproblem again.</p>\n<h1>Precautions</h1>\n<p>First, I immediately purchased the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Silicone keyboard cover for the Macbook Pro <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/143357622678\">example on ebay</a></li>\n<li>USB-C socket cover <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/302850677303\">example on ebay</a></li>\n<li>2x compressed air can</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once these arrived, I placed the USB-C covers in the sockets on the side of the\ncomputer.  This should prevent dust from building up in sockets.</p>\n<p>I gave the keyboard a thorough spray with the compressed air and, after confirming\nthere's no lint on the keyboard cover, placed it on top of my keys.</p>\n<p>Second, I installed the <a href=\"https://github.com/aahung/Unshaky/\">Unshaky</a> app\navailable on GitHub.  I did see some open issues with this version so consider\nstarting from v0.5.3 if you use the US keyboard layout.  Remember which keys\ncaused you problems before and immediately set them to a 40ms delay.  This\nshould cover up the issue if it appears without you even knowing.</p>\n<p>I was a bit wary about installing this app and giving it accessibility access so\nI forked the repository, restored it to commit\n<code class=\"language-text\">be5d0d93e9ced97ee508a6d27db3ae0f5974d181^</code> (note the caret means commit prior\nto this one), and built my own version.  This commit was before auto-update was\nadded.</p>\n<p>Finally, when plugging in the power supply at the wall end I made sure it was\ngrounded to prevent sparks from occuring at the USB-C port and damaging the\nlogic board.</p>\n<h1>Preventative care</h1>\n<p>You'll want to spray down your keys weekly to make sure there's no dust inside.\n(At least that is what Apple tells us.)  Give the silicone cover a good spray as\nwell when you do so.</p>\n<p>While I'm grateful for the free <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks\">keyboard service\nprogram</a>,\nit's the first time I've ever had a problem with a computer keyboard.  Can you\nimagine buying an Amiga and having problems with the keyboard?  I hope that when\nApple returns to the scissor-switches that they provide that option as a repair\nfor affected customers.</p>\n<p>Once the keyboard service program expires - which I believe is four years after\nthe purchase date - I'll sell this laptop and pick up the latest Lenovo T3XXX\nseries.  By that time hopefully we'll have 6 core CPUs with hyperthreading, 90Hz\ndisplays, at least 2K resolution as standard, with a 90 WHr battery.</p>\n<p>Have you found other ways to prevent the keys repeating?
