I think this decision probably has a lot of history but given that I'll have multiple tabs open at any time, I like to keep related tabs together, sort of a poor man's tree-style-tabs if you will.</p>\n<p>Now even though there are a <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/always-right/\">few</a> extensions that fix this and I'm also thinking about writing my own :), you can simply change your about:config as well to enable this change.</p>\n<p>Set <code class=\"language-text\">browser.tabs.insertAfterCurrent</code> in about:config to true.  I'm using Firefox Beta 70.0b9 so this may not be available in the current release yet.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2019-09-26","updated":null,"path":"/writing/firefox-new-tab-behavior","title":"Firefox new tab positioning behavior"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
