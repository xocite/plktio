This means I won't\nbe able to get a free HTTPS certificate from them until next week.  So for the\nfirst week of the New Year, this blog will continue to be hosted on GitHub\nPages.  I'll remove this note once the migration is complete!</strong></p>\n<p>Wow, what a year it has been.  If you're reading this, it means I've\nsuccessfully completed my first New Year's Resolution of hosting this website on\nmy own web server.  It is now live on a VPS at <a href=\"https://hetzner.com\">Hetzner</a>\ncomplete with a HTTPS certificate signed by <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org\">Let's\nEncrypt</a>.  While this isn't a huge achievement in\nitself, I've done much more than simply copy the static files to\n<em>/var/www/html</em>.</p>\n<h1>Short term plans</h1>\n<p>The journey to self-hosting this blog took longer than anticipated because I\nspent a lot of time creating a reproducible setup.  This means I can recreate\nthe plkt.io deployment on my local machine for testing with Vagrant and have\nthat same configuration be pushed on \"production\" aka this web server.</p>\n<p>To achieve this, I hand-crafted a series of incremental Dockerfiles that build\nthe container serving this page.  Starting from Debian, adding in Apache, and\nthen configuring certbot and building the website from JS.  I learned alot about\nsetting up infrastructure via code and having single application containers work\nwell.  There's still quite a bit left to do but for now I consider the <em>first\nphase</em> of my 2020 plan complete!</p>\n<p>In <em>Phase II</em>, I'll be moving from a simple <code class=\"language-text\">docker run</code> setup to something more\nglamorous /ahem/ I mean modern.  While the site by itself is rather simple, I do\nplan to expose more services here, with the next in line being a self-hosted git\nrepo at <a href=\"git.plkt.io\">git.plkt.io</a>.  This page will serve as the authoritive git\nrepo behind the site with a mirror of course available on GitHub.  Kubernetes to\nreplace my manual invocations (and incantations :)) will will be brought in\nincrementally and as needed over the course of a few months as I standardise how\nI roll out services on plkt.io.  At the moment, I don't plan to have multiple\nVMs running so will likely run each Kubernetes node using Linux containers\n(LXD).</p>\n<h1>Longer term plans</h1>\n<p>In <em>Phase III</em>, running concurrently with Phase II, I'll be migrating from this\nstatic website built with <a href=\"https://gatsbyjs.org\">GatsbyJS</a> to one served with\nWordpress.  While some might think this an irrational move, I have a lot of\ntrust in Wordpress and believe it's the less maintenance heavy option.  I'll be\nmigrating the entirety of my blog posts over and likely be breaking some URLs in\nthe process.  While it is considered faux paus to break links, I consider it a\nnecessary evil as I ship this blog upon a platform that I'm sure will be for the\nnext ten years. </p>\n<p>If you did bookmark a page and it no longer works, try the search\nfunctionality on Google\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#x26;q=site%3Aplkt.io%20%24SEARCH_TERM\">here</a> or\nvia Wordpress if this site has already been migrated.</p>\n<p><em>Phase IV</em> is where this site really starts to become notable and useful.  I'll be\nadding two major updates that add a bit of interactivity to the site.</p>\n<p>First, I'll be publishing a blog roll of my favourite blogs via an RSS feed and\nalso putting the snippets live on my site.  This doesn't necessarily mean I\napprove of everything written, rather, I find it as a directory of like-minded\nthinkers so people browsing this site can continue to find good content.</p>\n<p>Second, I'm going to spin up some data funnels where I can start recording\nevents that happen and present them on the site.  Examples include: (a) Git\nactivity by people I follow; (b) self-signed tarballs of things that I'm using\nin production so people have multiple sources of trust for packages; (c) and\nperhaps even some stock market analysis and trends.</p>\n<p>Overall, I think the additions will do well to improve the usefulness of my\nwebsite as a hub reflecting what I'm working on and what I'm capable of.  In\naddition, it's one small step closer to making content discovery easier in lieu\nof search engine dominance and apathy.  More to come in this space!</p>\n<p><em>Phase V</em> is still under wraps.  As my knowledge around moving workloads to the\ncloud, containerising applications, and building infrastructure with code\nimproves, I can envision myself start a cloud consulting business for my local\nregion.  Nothing finalised yet but something to shoot for in 2020.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2019-12-31","updated":null,"path":"/writing/bring-on-2020","title":"Looking forward to the next 10 years!"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
