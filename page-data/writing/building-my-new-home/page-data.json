Near the end of Geocities in 2009 and shortly after my switch to Linux full-time, I started writing longer articles on <a href=\"https://antonyjepson.wordpress.com\">Wordpress</a>.  I used Wordpress until around 2016, when static websites were becoming huge.  I had being eyeing my own domain for some time, finally went ahead and bought <a href=\"https://antonyjepson.co.uk\">antonyjepson.co.uk</a>, and got right at home on AWS with S3+CloudFront.  While this was a great starting point for writing my own HTML/CSS/JS, my enthusiasm had gotten the better of me and I didn't have the time to make my website look polished despite writing many posts.</p>\n<p>Most recently, I've starting building my new home: <a href=\"https://plkt.io\">plkt.io</a>.  I have time to create a polished and candid reflection of my personality.  The JAMstack powering the website consists of GatsbyJS and React to define the site and Amplify to build the site.  Over time, I expect to move closer to React + Kubernetes for definition and deployment and I'll be documenting that transition here in all its glory.</p>\n<p>As stated in my original conception <a href=\"https://antonyjepson.co.uk/building-plkt-io/\">post</a>, plkt.io will the primary source to see what I'm working in both the virtual and real worlds.  I'll continue to write useful tutorials with the goal of making them more accessible â€” with clearer writing, code syntax highlighting, and more visual content.  All my code will be available here and mirrored to <a href=\"https://github.com/xocite/plktio\">GitHub</a>.  Finally, I'll continue to look into the feasability of hosting custom builds of open source projects here, perhaps through a common package registry.</p>\n<p>You should expect the website to be a living thing with prior content always accessible through the Git hash.</p>\n<p>All I can say is, <strong>watch this space</strong>!</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2019-05-31","updated":"2019-06-06","path":"/writing/building-my-new-home","title":"Building my new home on the web"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
