Iâ€™ve worked at Microsoft, Agoda, Apple, and most recently on my own startup, Binaural Waves, crafting products that people love and use everyday.  I have technical experience in programming, system administration, and data crunching, in addition to driving features to their conclusion through product management.  Iâ€™ve traveled and worked across the globe and I take my worldwide experiences with me everywhere.</p>\n<p>I'm also passionate about new input modalities.  I think the keyboard and mouse,\nwhile likely here to stay for another decade or so, will eventually be replaced\nby new modalities that allow a broader range of expression.  This transition\nwill begin with programming.  I believe development should become a more\ninteractive experience not contrained by the 26 letters of the alphabet.  We\nshould be manipulating 3D objects instead -- which will give us an entire new\ndimension to think about.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we should dive deeper into abnormal brain responses, like seizures\nand synthesia, to see if there's additional input via light or sound that we're\nnot harnassing.  Programming shouldn't be a visual only affair and we should be\nable to use sound to augment what's being displayed on the screen.</p>\n<p>We should explore why seizures can be caused by flashing lights and see if there's an opportunity to turn this trigger into a way to communicate with the brain.  Furthermore, binaural beats are often lauded as a way to excite the various frequencies upon our brain operates.  Attuning our interface development to be more cognizant of the flexibility of human hearing and sight is something missing in today's interfaces.</p>\n<p>Back in 2008, I only had two devices.  Now, I have a variety of always connected\ndevices to maintain.  My primary device is my Macbook Pro, upon which I run\nvarious containers and virtual machines to stay abreast of the latest Linux\ndistributions and packages.  My secondary device is an old Dell M6800 which\nserves as an excellent Debian server.  I also have a phone.  All are gated\nbehind a pfsense router.</p>\n<p>In the next decade or so, we'll see huge advancements in network coverage, upload speed,lossless compression, and power storage.  These in tandem will give way to new applications such as in YouTube where videos is downloaded directly from creator's devices instead of being stored on a centralised server.</p>\n<p>In my spare time, I enjoy running, as I did when young, as a way to stay healthy\nand upbeat.  Music is also one of my favourite pastimes and you'll find me\nlistening to\n<a href=\"http://www.ulrich-schnauss.com\">Ulrich Schnauss</a>,\n<a href=\"https://bleep.com/artist/78-boards-of-canada\">Boards of Canda</a>\n<a href=\"http://radiohead.com\">Radiohead</a>,\nand <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls%27_Generation\">Girls' Generation</a>,\namong others.</p>\n<p>Finally, I consider myself an avid reader and enjoy works from the likes of Stephen King, Ken Catran, Ayn Rand, and many others.
