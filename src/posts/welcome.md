I've been writing online for years.  Near the end of Geocities in 2009 and shortly after my switch to Linux full-time, I started writing longer articles on [Wordpress][1].  I used Wordpress until around 2016, when static websites were becoming huge.  I had being eyeing my own domain for some time, finally went ahead and bought [antonyjepson.co.uk][2], and got right at home on AWS with S3+CloudFront.  While this was a great starting point for writing my own HTML/CSS/JS, my enthusiasm had gotten the better of me and I didn't have the time to make my website look polished despite writing many posts.

Most recently, I've starting building my new home: [plkt.io][3].  I have time to create a polished and candid reflection of my personality.  The JAMstack powering the website consists of GatsbyJS and React to define the site and Amplify to build the site.  Over time, I expect to move closer to React + Kubernetes for definition and deployment and I'll be documenting that transition here in all its glory.

As stated in my original conception [post][4], plkt.io will the primary source to see what I'm working in both the virtual and real worlds.  I'll continue to write useful tutorials with the goal of making them more accessible &mdash; with clearer writing, code syntax highlighting, and more visual content.  All my code will be available here and mirrored to [GitHub][5].  Finally, I'll continue to look into the feasability of hosting custom builds of open source projects here, perhaps through a common package registry.

You should expect the website to be a living thing with prior content always accessible through the Git hash.

All I can say is, **watch this space**!
