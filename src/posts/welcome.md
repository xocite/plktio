I've been writing blogs for years, starting originally with my [Wordpress site][1] back in 2008.  I moved to my [own domain][2] in 2016 and lived there happily for a few years.  Most recently, I've decided to call this new, shorter domain: [plkt.io][3] my home.  I intend for it to be the place where I can gather all my knowledge in one place.  As I become more familiar with Kubernetes, the JAMstack, and the entire new ecosystem of possibilities available on the Internet, expect this website to grow into something meaningful.

As stated in my original conception [post][4], plkt.io will the primary source to see what I'm working in both the virtual and real worlds.  I'll continue to write useful tutorials with the goal of making them more accessible -- with clearer writing, code syntax highlighting, and more diagrams.  All my code will be available here and mirrored to GitHub.   my archived videos, and potentially custom builds of open source projects.

I expect the website to be a living thing.  Blog posts are no longer permenant and you can expect me to update them regularly.

All I can say is, **watch this space**!
