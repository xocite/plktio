Here is a continuously growing list of things I've found interesting to watch, read, or listen to since July 2019.  This page will grow over time, so keep an eye on the update date.  Let me know if you enjoyed any of these or have anything interesting to share.

### July
* [Patches carved into developer
  sigchains](https://people.kernel.org/monsieuricon/patches-carved-into-developer-sigchains)
  `2019`: Konstantin Ryabitsev walks through a fascinating example of a
  hypothetical decentralised sneakernet that runs on secure scuttlebutt.
* [Files are fraught with peril](https://danluu.com/deconstruct-files/) `2019`:
  A very thorough look at the why Dropbox only supported ext4 for a while and
  the difficulties of file creation.
* [IBM Knative: A Complete Guide](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/knative)
  `April 2019`: This written guide has been essential for me to quickly
  understand a lot of the Knative concepts and how they integrate into a
  Kubernetes system.
