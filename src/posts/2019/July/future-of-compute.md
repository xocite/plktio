**In Progress Stream of Consciousness Writing**

I believe that the future of computing is multi-device.

By that I mean that each of us will be acutely aware of our compute capacity per device.  When we need to do something extraneous or beyond our natural capacity -- e.g. calculate our tax due, render our social image posts with filters in a decentralised manner, or send messages in other languages with real time translation, we'll need to use our phone, laptop, and other devices together to make the best impact.

This will likely consist of multiple devices scanning the same QR code and using their compute power (across architectures: ARM, AMD, X86, X64) to do distributed, private, compute.

More thoughts to come soon.  Let me know if you agree with this.
