I think this is a question that plagues nearly everyone: "How do I maintain that mental edge when working?"

It's a difficult thing to answer and ultimately everyone will have slightly different takes on what works for them.  The below is my framework for staying focused on deeply technical topics.

### Mindset
* I think it's incredibly important to **reduce the number of decisions you make
  daily**.  I've noticed that on days where I have to make many little decisions
  I find myself too drained to think deeply.  You can achieve this through many
  means, here are some examples:
  * Prepare your clothes for the following day before you sleep.  This reduces
    some morning anxiety if you need to enter a workplace.
  * Following on from the above, establish a morning routine that defines how
    you'll exercise, what you'll eat, and your route of transportation.

### Work
* There are several patterns you can implement at work to help free your mind of
  unnecessary churning.
  * Schedule times during the day to handle email.  Most email doesn't need to
    be answered immediately.  This means not opening the mail app at all because
    even subject-line snooping will be enough to occupy your mind.
  * Establish a protocol at work for urgent messages.  Let people know that
    urgent requests should include an expected response time and should ideally
    be formatted in a y/n format so you can reply quickly.  
  * Try to reduce your eating frequency - I've found that eating twice a day or
    even once a day seems to improve mental clarity throughout the day.
  * Reduce "get-started" anxiety by letting people jump start their own ideas
    in a form light of requirements.  This is called MVP by some, MVC by others,
    but empower people to propose things without worrying about having to
    define a completed product.
  * When you leave the office, imagine yourself placing all your troubles into a
    bag or a container and dropping it at the entrance.  Know that you can
    collect them the following day.  Really imagine the load being reduced as
    you physically drop them.
