I think this is a question that plagues nearly everyone: "How do I maintain that mental edge when working?"

It's a difficult thing to answer and ultimately everyone will have slightly different takes on what works for them.  The below is my framework for staying focused on deeply technical topics.

### Mindset
I think it's incredibly important to **reduce the number of decisions you make
daily**.  I've noticed that on days where I have to make many little decisions
I find myself too drained to think deeply.  You can achieve this through many
means, here are some examples:
* Prepare your clothes for the following day before you sleep.  This reduces
  some morning anxiety if you need to enter a workplace.
* Following on from the above, establish a morning routine that defines how
  you'll exercise, what you'll eat, and your route of transportation.
* Try to reduce your eating frequency - I've found that eating twice a day or
  even once a day seems to improve mental clarity throughout the day.
* Accept failure and accept mistakes.  Problems are a part of life but they
  rarely pull you away from well-defined goals.  Accept them.

### Activities
Beyond setting the stage for a good, clear mind.  There are some activities you
can do to get unstuck when you can't seem to make headway.
* **Go for a walk**.  I can't stress this enough - going for a walk, even for
  only 5 minutes is the quickest and most reliable way I've found to unblock the
  mind.  Quell your worry by telling yourself it's only a 2 minute walk.  After
  you step outside you'll likely walk for longer.  Don't be afraid to do
  multiple loops.
* Read some fiction.  Immersing yourself in an alternate reality for a while can
  let you stash some of your mental blockers.  Really focus on imagining what
  the author wrote to make use of your left brain faculties.

### Work
There are several patterns you can implement at work to help free your mind of
unnecessary churning.
* Schedule times during the day to handle email.  Most email doesn't need to
  be answered immediately.  This means not opening the mail app at all because
  even subject-line snooping will be enough to occupy your mind.
* Establish a protocol at work for urgent messages.  Let people know that
  urgent requests should include an expected response time and should ideally
  be formatted in a y/n format so you can reply quickly.  
* Delegate where possible to people you trust.  Empower people to make
  decisions on your behalf.
* Reduce "get-started" anxiety by letting people jump start their own ideas
  in a form light of requirements.  This is called MVP by some, MVC by others,
  but empower people to propose things without worrying about having to
  define a completed product.
* When you leave the office, imagine yourself placing all your troubles into a
  bag or a container and dropping it at the entrance.  Know that you can
  collect them the following day.  Really imagine the load being reduced as
  you physically drop them.

Do you have other techniques for keeping your mind fresh throughout the day?
