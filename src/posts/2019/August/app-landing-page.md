An app I've been working on for six months is now live on the iOS App Store.
Introducing *Binaural Waves*, an app to help you focus and relax with smooth
sound tones.  Use this app when you need to hunker down and get things done or
when you need to chill out.

This is the first release and I have a lot planned over the coming months.
