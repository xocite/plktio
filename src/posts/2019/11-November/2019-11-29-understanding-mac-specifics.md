I use a Mac as my main dev box for better or for worse.  I also use a mini-PC for deployments I want accessible to all my devices.  To orchestrate all these devices, I use a combination of [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/index.html), for virtual machine provisioning, [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), for writing playbooks to get the *ahem* required *ahem* Docker installed, and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to handle my containers.  I am also building a local container registry which houes custom builds of various programs.  Of course, all this is run locally by [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube), the Kubernetes local cluster.

It's quite a complicated setup and I was using LXD before but I just found snapd to cause so many difficult to debug problems that I decided to fully embrace the, as Elon puts it, massive spire in the topological map of technological advancements (from this [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3lUEnMaiAU)).

Before installing all these programs, I took some time to look at how services and networking is managed in macOS as I just knew I would run into some configuration problems down the road.

# Networking
Most of macOS networking is sufficiently handled with the System Preferences Networking pane.  For quick terminal look up, you can use the netstat and ifconfig tools.  On modern distros, these tools are supplanted by `ss` and `ip` respectively.

# System services
[`launchd`](https://www.launchd.info/) manages the daemons, applications, processes, and scripts in macOS.  It's not as powerful as a modern installation of systemd but it just works, so to speak.  Agents and daemons are usually stored in the /Library set of directories: ~/Library for local agents, /Library for global agents, and /System/Library for system agents.

These directories contain XML files that specify what they want launchd to do for a particular service.  Go ahead and run `launchctl list` to see the list of loaded services.  Like systemctl you can run `launchctl enable <service>` to start something and with `disable` to disable it.

When I'm troubleshooting problems it can be informative to list all the non-Apple agents with `launchctl list | grep -v 'com.apple'`.

```
launchctl list | grep -v 'com.apple'

Let's say I want to see the status of VSCode -- I can use the gui service specifier.

However, what about the sneaky java auto-updater?  It's not running now but surely it's scheduled to phone home at some point in the next few minutes ;).  How do I check the run frequency of it?  We can look at the property list file to find more information.  Querying launchctl seems to change between releases so what works on Mojave might not work in Catalina.

Java's property list file is installed globally in /Library/LaunchAgents.
```
ï£¿ $ cat /Library/LaunchAgents/com.oracle.java.Java-Updater.plist

</plist>
```

It's scheduled to run weekly.  We can disable the auto-updater with `launchctl remove <LaunchDaemon>` -- in this case `launchctl remove com.oracle.java.Java-Updater`.  Now the java auto-updater no longer appears in the list of LaunchAgents.
