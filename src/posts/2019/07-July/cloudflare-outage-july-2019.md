From John Graham-Cumming's post on Cloudflare's [blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/details-of-the-cloudflare-outage-on-july-2-2019/),

 > On July 2, we deployed a new rule in our WAF Managed Rules that caused CPUs to become exhausted on every CPU core that handles HTTP/HTTPS traffic on the Cloudflare network worldwide.

 A very well written summary that actually acts as a pretty good advertisement for Cloudflare.
